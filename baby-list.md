# For the birth

- pregnancy folder (from the midwife)
- ID
- phone
- think if I am allergic to anything (medicines, anesthetic) -- I don't think so
- at the maternity, before birth, they should check the blood to see how quick it coagulates
- if they do oxitocin injection (for dilating quicker): make sure they monitor the baby's heartbeat
- hygiene objects: toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, towel, deodorant, toilet paper (check during visit at Ystad what is necessary), hair stuff
- single-serving underwear (special type for after birth)
- 2 packages of cotton-wool/wadding (??), sterile cloth to wrap it (for the first 2 days) 
- big hygienic pads (from day 3 on)
- special rectangular cloth with one side in plastic (to sit on so as blood doesn't permeate); it's the same for the changing diapers table
- slippers for indoors
- 3 pairs of socks
- absorbant thingies for the nipples
- night gowns (3ish; they can get stained with blood and/or milk)
- some warm clothes (it's common to get cold chills after birth)
- breast cream containing Lanolin (Ro name: Garmastan); does not necessarily need to be washed off before breastfeeding
- breast pump for milking (manual is only ok in the beginning, when you don't have lots of milk; later better automatic, otherwise the hands will hurt when pumping)
- water, some snacks, single-serving plates and glasses (?? probably not necessary)
- tea for stimulating lactation
- Propolis (=bee glue) + calendula (=marigold) or resin (for helping the healing)
- breastfeeding cushion
- photo camera S
