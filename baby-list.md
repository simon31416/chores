# For the birth

- pregnancy folder (from the midwife)
- ID
- phone
- think if I am allergic to anything (medicines, anesthetic) -- I don't think so
- at the maternity, before birth, they should check the blood to see how quick it coagulates
- if they do oxitocin injection (for dilating quicker): make sure they monitor the baby's heartbeat
- hygiene objects: toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, towel, deodorant, toilet paper (check during visit at Ystad what is necessary), hair stuff
- single-serving underwear (special type for after birth)
- 2 packages of cotton-wool/wadding (??), sterile cloth to wrap it (for the first 2 days) 
- big hygienic pads (from day 3 on)
- special rectangular cloth with one side in plastic (to sit on so as blood doesn't permeate); it's the same for the changing diapers table
- slippers for indoors
- 3 pairs of socks
- absorbant thingies for the nipples
- night gowns (3ish; they can get stained with blood and/or milk)
- some warm clothes (it's common to get cold chills after birth)
- breast cream containing Lanolin (Ro name: Garmastan); does not necessarily need to be washed off before breastfeeding
- breast pump for milking (manual is only ok in the beginning, when you don't have lots of milk; later better automatic, otherwise the hands will hurt when pumping)
- water, some snacks, single-serving plates and glasses (?? probably not necessary)
- tea for stimulating lactation
- Propolis (=bee glue) + calendula (=marigold) or resin (for helping the healing) cream
- breastfeeding cushion
- photo camera S
- pack in a bag with many pockets, to be able to put baby's stuff and my stuff separately and find them easily (will be useful after birth too)
- baby clothes (washed!): bodies with legs (several, pee might leak on the legs); 2 hats; gloves (to avoid scratching); clothes for outdoors for when we leave the hospital (don't dress to much or too little!)
- towels for baby / "carpe finet"
- diapers new-born size 1



# For home right after birth 
- baby bottles for milked milk (always to be sterilized by boiling in water for 5 minutes, and kept in a separate pot with a lid), "tetine"; thermal insulation cover for bottle
- for butt irritation: Bepanthen, Cutaden, or Calendula cream (should NOT contain boric acid, fenol, or metil salicitat)
- sterile compressions for the belly button (preferably texture like wet towels, not like "tifon" which can stick), also used to clean eyes and ears
- sterile solution ("ser fiziologic perfuzabil") 1L, seringes to take it out - for cleaning eyes and ears
- butt termometer for new-borns
- sanitary alcohol to sterilize the butt thermometer
- antibiotic powder to prevent infections (of the belly button?)
- wet towels (no parfume, no paraben)
- body moisturizer for baby (no parfume, no paraben) -- babies shed skin in the first 2 weeks, need frequent moisturization
- washing gel (no parfume, no paraben), functions also as shampoo
- weak lights, especially on top of the changing table (for night nappy changes)
- baby nail scissors
- trash can with lid for dirty nappies on the balcony
- anti-colic syrup for babies
- protection layer (with plastic) for the baby bed and for the big bed (they are different, IKEA has both)
- washing basin (my sister might send the bucket, good for the first months)
